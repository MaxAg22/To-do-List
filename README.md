# üìù To-Do List Web App

This is a web application where you can record and manage all your pending tasks.

It‚Äôs a re-design of my first to-do list project. Instead of using local storage, this version uses a **MySQL database** to store users and their tasks. The motivation behind this app was to explore web architecture and technologies such as **JavaScript, HTML, Node.js**, and more ‚Äî and to understand how the front-end, back-end, and database communicate with each other.

I'd also like to mention [PuntoJson](https://www.youtube.com/@puntojson), whose videos were incredibly helpful for learning these concepts. The core login and registration logic is based on his tutorials, but I extended it by integrating database operations and query handling.

- Persistent data using MySQL
